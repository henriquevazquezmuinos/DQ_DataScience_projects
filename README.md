# DQ_DataScience_projects

Small Data Science projects from the dataquest.io learning platform.
The projects correspond to the Data Scientist career specialization 
and were completed by me.

For simplicity, each project is contained in its own branch.
The projects are self contained in the form of either a documented 
jupyter notebook or script.

In some branches, certain projects might be developed further using 
more advanced models, deviating from the original project goal of 
the dataquest projects.
